<a href="http://baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Fate/Zero:Prologue" title="Let's go to youtube">Read Fate/Zero</a>


<p>Fate/Zero is a light novel that serves as to the prequel to the visual novel Fate/Stay Night</p>
<p>It was also later adapted into an animated series.</p>
<p>I chose Fate/Zero to recommend because it shows how a universe can be fleshed out through various different mediums.</p>
<p>By listening to the soundtrack composed for the "Fate" series, reading its novel, experiencing its visual novel,</p>
<p>and watching the animated series, one is able to experience the vision of its creators in a full auditory, visual and semantic experience.</p>
<p>The premise of Fate/Zero is as follows: 7 Mages called "Masters" each summon a powerful "Servant" from the past to war wage for the Holy Grail,</p>
<p>an omnipresent device said to grant wishes. These servants range from heroes of the past like Alexander the Great, to figures of legend like King Arthur,</p>
<p>to great rulers in history like Gilgamesh, king of Babylon. Only 1 Master and their Servant can claim victory and therefore the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>As the story nears its conclusion, the true nature of the Holy Grail is revealed.</p>
